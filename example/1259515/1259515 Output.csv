The Company unlocks the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use, homes more comfortable, appliances more energy efficient, and families more secure. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 27, 2003."
1259515,Reclassifications,"Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current-year presentation. A reclassification was made from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) related to foreign currency transaction gains (losses). As a result, income from operations is impacted by $0 and $34,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, but this reclassification did not impact previously reported net income, or related per share amounts. In addition, a reclassification was made related to international hospitality revenue previously disclosed as United States hospitality revenue. The reclassification did not materially impact previous disclosures related to geographic information. Furthermore, this reclassification had no effect on previously reported amounts related to total revenue, income from continuing operations, net income or related per share amounts, and does not impact previous disclosures regarding concentrations of revenue."
1259515,Basis of Presentation,The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1259515,Segment Reporting,"Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, the Chief Executive Officer, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and accessing performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as one operating segment."
1259515,Concentrations of Risk,"The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from its worldwide network of independent dealers and distributors. The Company’s sales to dealers and distributors located outside the United States are generally denominated in United States dollars, except for sales to dealers and distributors located in the United Kingdom and the European Union, which are generally denominated in pounds sterling and the euro, respectively. There were no individual account balances greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014."
1259515,Geographic Information,"The Company’s revenue includes amounts earned through sales to dealers and distributors located outside of the United States. With the exception of Canada, no single foreign country accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The following table sets forth revenue from the U.S., Canadian and all other international dealers and distributors combined (in thousands):"
1259515,Use of Accounting Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition, sales returns, provisions for doubtful accounts, product warranty, inventory obsolescence, litigation, determination of fair value of stock options, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes. Actual results may differ from those estimates."
1259515,Product Warranty,"The Company provides its customers a limited product warranty of two years, which requires the Company, at its option, to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer or refund the purchase price. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred to replace, repair or issue a refund for defective products and records a reserve at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed systems, the Company’s historical experience and management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of product warranty returns, net of refurbished products. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability each period and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary. Warranty costs accrued includes amounts accrued for products at the time of shipment, adjustments for changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in the period, and changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in prior periods. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amounts applicable to each of these components."
1259515,Net Income (Loss) Per Share,"Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period that have a dilutive effect on net income per share. Potentially dilutive common shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and warrants using the if-converted method. In a net loss position, diluted net loss per share is computed using only the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as any additional common shares would be anti-dilutive."
1259515,Revenue Recognition,"The Company sells its products through a network of independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors generally sell the Company’s products to the end consumer as part of a bundled sale, which typically includes other third-party products and related services, project design and installation services and on-going support. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for dealer, retailer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of volume rebates, at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms and the Company’s historical experience and trend analysis. The most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to dealers and distributors for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. The Company’s products include embedded software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware. Accordingly, the hardware and embedded software are accounted for as a single deliverable. In 2013, the Company began bundling Control4 App software licenses with its new controllers. These software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates (e.g., when-and-if-available enhancements or upgrades to the functionality of the software) or post-contract customer support such as technical support. When a software license and controller are sold together, a multiple element arrangement exists and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling prices. Typically, delivery of both the product and the software license occurs at the same time. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product or licensed software is considered delivered once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. Software license revenue represents fees earned from activating applications which allow end consumers to manage and control their automation systems using tablets, smartphones and other third-party devices. Software products such as Composer Home and Media Editions are sold on a limited basis and do not constitute a significant portion of revenue. The Company’s perpetual software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates or upgrades or post-contract customer support such as technical support; the Company generally recognizes revenue at the time the software license is provided. The Company offers a subscription service that allows consumers to control and monitor their homes remotely and allows the Company’s dealers to perform remote diagnostic services. Subscription revenue is deferred at the time of payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the service is provided.  Total revenue for subscription services represents less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented. The Company recognizes revenue net of cost of revenue for third-party products sold through the Company’s online ordering system. While the Company assumes credit risk on sales to its dealers and distributors for third-party products, the Company does not determine the product selling price, does not retain associated inventory risks and is not the primary obligor to the end consumer. The Company’s agreements with dealers and distributors generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions. Even though contractual agreements do not provide return privileges, there are circumstances in which the Company will accept returns. In addition, agreements with certain retail distributors contain price protection and limited rights of return. The Company maintains a reserve for such returns based on the Company’s historical return experience. Shipping charges billed to dealers and distributors are included in revenue and related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue."
1259515,Cost of Revenue,"Cost of revenue includes the following: the cost of inventory sold during the period, inventory write-down costs, payroll, purchasing costs, royalty obligations, shipping expenses to dealers and distributors and warehousing costs, which include inbound freight costs from manufacturers, rent and payroll and benefit costs."
1259515,Cash and Cash Equivalents,The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
1259515,Restricted Cash,"Restricted cash as of December 31, 2014, is composed of a guarantee made by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom to HM Revenue & Customs related to a customs duty deferment account."
1259515,Allowance for Doubtful Accounts,"The Company extends credit to the majority of its dealers and distributors, which consist primarily of small, local businesses. Issuance of credit is based on ongoing credit evaluations by the Company of dealers’ and distributors’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible receivables. The allowance is based upon the creditworthiness of the Company’s dealers and distributors, the dealers’ and distributors’ historical payment experience, the age of the receivables and current market and economic conditions. Provisions for potentially uncollectible accounts are recorded in sales and marketing expenses. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances to the allowance for doubtful accounts when it becomes likely that they will not be collected."
1259515,Inventories,"Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of its inventory and reduces the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in excess of forecasted sales requirements. Inventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as a cost of revenue and totaled $1.5 million, $2.3 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively."
1259515,Property and Equipment,"Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:"
1259515,Intangible Assets,"Intangible assets primarily consist of acquired technology. The Company amortizes, to cost of revenue, definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the life of the technology."
1259515,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1259515,Foreign Currency Translatino,"The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong and India are the Pound Sterling, the Chinese Yuan, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Indian Rupee, respectively. The subsidiary’s assets and liabilities have been translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Statements of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for each year. Resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) resulting from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in other income (expense) and have not been material for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 or 2014."
1259515,Stock-Based Compensation,"The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards issued to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. The Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value at the date of grant for stock options. The Company elected to amortize compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method, under which stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee performs the related services, generally the vesting period of four years, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has estimated forfeiture rates based on its historical experience and will update the rates, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates."
1259515,Income Taxes,The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
1259515,Presentation of Certain Taxes,The Company collects various taxes from dealers and distributors and remits these amounts to the applicable taxing authorities. The Company’s accounting policy is to exclude these taxes from revenue and cost of revenue.
1259515,Research and Development,"Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including incentive compensation, depreciation associated with research and development equipment, contract labor and consulting services, facilities- related costs, and travel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred."
1259515,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, ‘‘Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.’’ The amended guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows as it relates only to financial statement presentation."
