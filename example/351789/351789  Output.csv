351789,Use of Estimates,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, including the underlying assumptions, consist of the economic lives of long lived assets, realizability of accounts receivable, and valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities, inventory, investments, allocation of the purchase price for acquired tangible and intangible assets, contingent earn-out, and stock compensation expense. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates may change in the near term."
351789,Cash and Cash Equivalents,"The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are invested in commercial paper, money market accounts and may also be invested in three month Treasury Bills.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value."
351789,Trade receivables and credit policies,Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date.  Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer.  Customer account balances with invoices over 90 days are considered delinquent. The Company does not accrue interest on delinquent trade receivables.
351789,Available-for-sale securities,"The Company’s investments consist of equity securities, primarily common stocks and government debt securities.  The estimated fair value of publicly traded equity securities is based on reported market prices, and therefore subject to the inherent risk of market fluctuations.  "
351789,Fair Value measurements,The Company’s policies incorporate the guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis.  These policies also incorporate the guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.  The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
351789,Inventories,"Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market."
351789,Property and Equipment,Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized.
351789,Intangible Assets,Intangible assets are comprised of a noncompete agreement and the HazardPROTM technology.  The cost of intangible assets is amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
351789,Revenue Recognition,"The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its production monitoring equipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been picked up by common carrier, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenue on products sold to customers and distributors upon shipment because the contracts do not include post-shipment obligations.  The Company may offer discounts that are recorded at the time of sale.  In addition to exchanges and warranty returns, customers have limited refund rights.  Historically, returns and refunds have been minimal and immaterial to the financial statements and are generally recognized when the returned product is received by the Company. In some situations, the Company receives advance payments from its customers. The recognition of revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the product is shipped or services performed.    "
351789,Advertising Costs,"The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expense was $ 57 and $ 59 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Research and Development,"Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.  The Company incurred expenses of $810 and $560 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Income Taxes,"Deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities is determined annually. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for those differences that have future tax consequences using the currently enacted tax laws and rates that apply to the periods in which they are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the current tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the portion of the deferred liability allocated to other comprehensive income. Deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that realization of the related deferred tax asset is not assured.  No valuation allowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2014 and 2013."
351789,Net income per common share,Basic EPS excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. 
351789,Stock Compensation,"The Company records compensation expense for stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) model.  The Company uses historical data, among other factors, to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. At December 31, 2014, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans."
