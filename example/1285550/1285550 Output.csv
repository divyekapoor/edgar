1285550,Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.",
1285550,Cash and Cash Equivalents,Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.,
1285550,Derivative Liability for Warrants to Purchase Common Stock,"Derivative liabilities for warrants represents the fair value of warrants issued in connection with certain private placements of shares of the Company’s common stock (see Note 7). The fair values of these warrants are presented as liabilities based on certain net cash settlement and exercise price reset, or “down round,” provisions. These derivative liabilities, which are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are calculated utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method. Changes in the fair values of these warrants are recognized as other income or expense in the related statement of operations.",
1285550,Other Derivative Financial Instruments,"The Company adjusts its derivative financial instruments to fair value at each balance sheet date (see Note 6). Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded each reporting period as gains or losses in the statements of operations unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.",
1285550,Fair Value Measurements,"The Company measures and records certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The table below reflects the carrying values and the estimated fair values, based on Level 3 inputs, of the Company’s outstanding notes payable including the related accrued interest at December 31, 2014: Carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. GAAP provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority, referred to as Level 1, to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The next priority, referred to as Level 2, is given to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability. The lowest priority, referred to as Level 3, is given to unobservable inputs. The table below reflects the level of the inputs used in the Company’s fair value calculation for instruments carried at fair value at (see Note 7):",
1285550,Inventory,"Inventory is carried at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) or net realizable value. All items included in inventory relate to the Company’s ClearPoint system. Software license inventory that is not expected to be utilized within the next twelve months is classified as a non-current asset. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolete items and provides a reserve upon identification of potential obsolete items.",
1285550,Property and Equipment,"Property and equipment, including certain long-term loaned ClearPoint systems, are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principally five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.",
1285550,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,"The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets (finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment). Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the expected undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the net book value of the related assets. If the net book value of the related assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the assets, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of the expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013.",
1285550,Revenue Recognition,"The Company’s revenues are comprised of: (1) product revenues resulting from the sale of ClearPoint system reusable products, disposable products and ClearTrace system components; (2) license and development arrangements; (3) development service revenues; and (4) other service revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price or fee is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and, for product revenues, risk of loss has transferred to the customer. For all sales, the Company requires either a purchase agreement or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. The Company analyzes revenue recognition on an agreement by agreement basis. The Company determines whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined by GAAP. Application of GAAP regarding multiple-element arrangements requires management to make subjective judgments about the values of the individual elements and whether delivered elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship.",
1285550,Product Warranties,"The Company’s standard policy is to warrant ClearPoint system reusable products against defects in material or workmanship for one year following installation. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and continues to be an immaterial amount. A periodic review of warranty obligations is performed to determine the adequacy of the reserve and adjustments, recorded to cost of product revenues, are made to the estimated warranty liability (included in other accrued liabilities) as appropriate.",
1285550,Research and Development Costs,"Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred. These costs include direct salary and employee benefit-related costs for research and development personnel, costs for materials used in research and development activities, sponsored research and costs for outside services. Since most of the expenses associated with the Company’s development service revenues relate to existing internal resources, these amounts are included in research and development costs.",
1285550,Income Taxes,"Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis. Such assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income or loss in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets unless, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.",
1285550,Net Loss Per Share,"Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without giving consideration to common stock equivalents. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share does not include the weighted average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. The following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because of the anti-dilutive result:",
1285550,Share-Based Compensation,"The Company accounts for compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or other equity instruments (including options and warrants) based on fair value. The fair value of each award is estimated as of the grant date and amortized as compensation expense over the requisite vesting period. The fair values of the Company’s share-based awards are estimated on the grant dates using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock volatility, estimated award terms and risk-free interest rates for the expected terms. To estimate the expected terms, the Company utilizes the “simplified” method for “plain vanilla” options discussed in the Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (“SAB 107”) issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company believes that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method apply to the Company and the Company’s share-based compensation arrangements. The Company intends to utilize the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior becomes available. The Company based its estimate of expected volatility on the average of historical volatilities of publicly traded companies it deemed similar to the Company because the Company lacks its own relevant historical volatility data. The Company will consistently apply this methodology until it has sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the Company’s own share prices to use as the input for all of its fair value calculations for share-based compensation. The Company utilizes risk-free interest rates based on zero-coupon U.S. treasury instruments, the terms of which are consistent with the expected terms of the equity awards. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero.",
1285550,Fair Value Determination of Share-Based Transactions,"Since May 21, 2012, the Company’s common stock has been traded in the over-the-counter market and has been quoted on the OTCQB marketplace and the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol MRIC. Since the Company’s common stock has been publicly traded, the closing stock price has been used as a key input in determining the fair value for share-based transactions. Prior to the time the Company’s stock became publicly traded, the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as well as the common stock underlying options and warrants, granted as compensation, or issued in connection with the settlement of liabilities (“share-based transactions”), were estimated by management, with input from a third-party valuation specialist from time to time. Determining the fair value of shares of privately held companies requires making complex and subjective judgments. Prior to the time the Company’s common stock was publicly traded, the Company used the income approach, the market approach, and the probability weighted expected return method to estimate the enterprise values for the dates on which these transactions occurred. The assumptions used in each of the different valuation methods take into account certain discounts such as selecting the appropriate discount rate and control and lack of marketability discounts. The discount rates used in these valuations ranged from 22% to 35%. The discounts for lack of marketability ranged from 15% to 35% and the discounts for lack of control ranged from 20% to 30%. If different discount rates or lack of marketability and control discounts had been used, the valuations would have been different. The enterprise value under each valuation method was allocated to preferred and common shares taking into account the enterprise value available to all stockholders and allocating that value among the various classes of stock based on the rights, privileges, and preferences of the respective classes in order to provide an estimate of the fair value of a share of the Company’s common stock. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates.",
1285550,Concentration Risks and Other Risks and Uncertainties,"Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the United States insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At December 31, 2014, the Company had bank balances in excess of the insured limits of approximately $514,000, most of which was held on deposit to satisfy outstanding checks.","Accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and all product revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, relate to sales and services to customers located in the United States (“U.S.”) and to one distributor. At December 31, 2014, two customers in the U.S. represented 20% and 17% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2013, three customers in the U.S. represented 28%, 18% and 15% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. No other customer represented more that 8.5% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 or 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales to one customer represented 10.4% of product revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to one customer represented 20% of product revenues. No other single customer represented greater than 9% of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company will provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collections become doubtful, but the Company has not experienced any credit losses or recorded any allowances to date. The Company is subject to risks common to emerging companies in the medical device industry, including, but not limited to: new technological innovations; dependence on key personnel; dependence on key suppliers; changes in general economic conditions and interest rates; protection of proprietary technology; compliance with changing government regulations; uncertainty of widespread market acceptance of products; access to credit for capital purchases by customers; and product liability claims. Certain components used in manufacturing have relatively few alternative sources of supply, and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly. The inability of any of these suppliers to fulfill the Company’s supply requirements may negatively impact future operating results."
1285550,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which creates a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for the Company beginning in 2017 and allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if “conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on future disclosures concerning its liquidity position.",
