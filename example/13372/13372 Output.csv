13372,About,"NU Consolidated: NU is a public utility holding company primarily engaged through its wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries in the energy delivery business. On April 10, 2012, NU acquired NSTAR and its subsidiaries. See Note 21, ""Merger of NU and NSTAR,"" for further information regarding the merger. NU's wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas. NU provides energy delivery service to approximately 3.6 million electric and natural gas customers through these six regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On February 2, 2015, NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO commenced doing business as Eversource Energy."
13372,Basis of Presentation,"The consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P and WMECO are herein collectively referred to as the ""financial statements."" "
13372,Accounting Standards,"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: On January 1, 2014, as required, NU prospectively adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) final Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that required presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets. Implementation of this guidance had an immaterial impact on the balance sheets and no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO."
13372,Cash and Cash Equivalents,"Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash and Cash Equivalents to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets. "
13372,Provision for Uncollctiable Accounts,"NU, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, presents its receivables at estimated net realizable value by maintaining a provision for uncollectible accounts. This provision is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including the application of an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category. The estimate is based upon historical collection and write-off experience and management's assessment of collectability from customers. Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts collectability estimates based on actual experience. Receivable balances are written off against the provision for uncollectible accounts when the accounts are terminated and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible. "
13372,"Fuel, Materials and Supplies and Allowance Inventory","Fuel, Materials and Supplies include natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories as well as materials purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes. Natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories are valued at their respective weighted average cost. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. As of December 31, 2014, NU and PSNH had $164.3 million and $95.1 million, respectively, of fuel and $185.4 million and $53 million, respectively, of materials and supplies. As of December 31, 2013, NU and PSNH had $139.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively, of fuel and $163.7 million and $54.5 million, respectively, of materials and supplies."
13372,Restricted Cash and Other Deposits,"As of December 31, 2014, NU, CL&P and PSNH had $3.2 million, $2.1 million, and $1 million respectively, of restricted cash relating to amounts held in escrow, which were included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts were $1.7 million and $1.4 million for NU and CL&P, respectively. "
13372,Fair Value Measurements,"Fair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as ""normal purchases or normal sales"" (normal) and to the marketable securities held in trusts. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs, and is also used to estimate the fair value of preferred stock and long-term debt."
13372,Derivative Accounting,"Many of the Regulated companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives. The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative. For the Regulated companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivative contracts, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates."
13372,Equity Method Investments,"Regional Decommissioned Nuclear Companies: CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO own common stock in three regional nuclear generation companies (CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, collectively referred to as the Yankee Companies), each of which owned a single nuclear generating facility that has been decommissioned. For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, the respective investments in CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC are accounted for under the equity method. NU consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's combined ownership interest in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the NU financial statements. "
13372,Revenues,"Regulated Companies: The Regulated companies' retail revenues are based on rates approved by their respective state regulatory commissions. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions. The Regulated companies' rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to their customers, including a return on investment. The Regulated companies also utilize regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms to recover certain costs on a fully-reconciling basis. These tracking mechanisms require rates to be changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred. WMECO and CL&P (effective December 1, 2014), each have a revenue decoupling mechanism to recover a pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenues per year, independent of actual customer usage. Decoupling mechanisms effectively break the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. "
13372,Operating Expenses,"Costs related to fuel and natural gas included in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the statements of income were as follows:"
13372,Allowance for Funds Used During Construction,"AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction and is included in the cost of the Regulated companies' utility plant. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of Other Interest Expense, and the AFUDC related to equity funds is recorded as Other Income, Net on the statements of income. AFUDC costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a result of higher depreciation expense."
13372,"Other Income, Net","Items included within Other Income, Net on the statements of income primarily consist of investment income/(loss), interest income, AFUDC related to equity funds, and equity in earnings. Investment income/(loss) primarily relates to debt and equity securities held in trust. For further information, see Note 5, ""Marketable Securities,"" to the financial statements. For further information on AFUDC related to equity funds, see Note 1M, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Allowance for Funds Used During Construction,"" to the financial statements. "
13372,Other Taxes,Gross receipts taxes levied by the state of Connecticut are collected by CL&P and Yankee Gas from their respective customers. These gross receipts taxes are shown on a gross basis with collections in Operating Revenues and payments in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the statements of income as follows:
13372,Supplemental Cash Flow Information,"In 2014, as a result of damages awarded to the Yankee Companies for spent nuclear fuel lawsuits against the DOE described in Note 11C, ""Commitments and Contingencies - Contractual Obligations - Yankee Companies,"" NU received total proceeds of $132.1 million, which were net of $80.6 million in proceeds CYAPC and YAEC returned to non-affiliated member companies. "
