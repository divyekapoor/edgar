351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Nature of business:,"The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Electro-Sensors, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ESI Investment Company and Senstar Corporation. Senstar has no operations.  Intercompany accounts, transactions and earnings have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated entity is referred to as “the Company” or “ESI”.Electro-Sensors, Inc. manufactures and markets a complete line of speed monitoring and motor control systems for industrial machinery. The Company uses leading-edge technology to continuously improve its products and make them easier to use, with the ultimate goal of manufacturing the industry-preferred product for every market served. The Company’s products are sold through an internal sales staff, manufacturer’s representatives, and distributors in a wide variety of manufacturers and processors who use the products to monitor process machinery operations. The Company markets its products to a variety of different industries located throughout the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.In addition, through its subsidiary ESI Investment Company, the Company periodically makes strategic investments in other businesses, primarily when the Company believes that these investments will facilitate development of technology complementary to the Company’s products. Although ESI, through its subsidiary ESI Investment Company, invests in other businesses, the Company does not intend to become an investment company and intends to remain primarily an operating company.    See Note 3 for additional information regarding its investments.  The Company’s investments in securities are subject to normal market risks.Significant accounting policies of the Company are summarized below:"
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Use of estimates,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, including the underlying assumptions, consist of the economic lives of long lived assets, realizability of accounts receivable, and valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities, inventory, investments, allocation of the purchase price for acquired tangible and intangible assets, contingent earn-out, and stock compensation expense. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates may change in the near term."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Cash and cash equivalents,"The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are invested in commercial paper, money market accounts and may also be invested in three month Treasury Bills.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value.The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in primarily one bank deposit account, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Trade receivables and credit policies,"Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date.  Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer.  Customer account balances with invoices over 90 days are considered delinquent. The Company does not accrue interest on delinquent trade receivables.Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  Management individually reviews all trade receivable balances that exceed 90 days from the invoice date and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that may not be collected.  Management uses this information to estimate the allowance."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Available-for-sale securities,"The Company’s investments consist of equity securities, primarily common stocks and government debt securities.  The estimated fair value of publicly traded equity securities is based on reported market prices, and therefore subject to the inherent risk of market fluctuations.  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investments are acquired, and evaluates the appropriateness of this classification at each balance sheet date.Since the Company does not buy and sell investments with the objective of generating profits on short-term fluctuations in market price, the investments in marketable equity securities have been classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and within accumulated other comprehensive income. Dividends on marketable equity securities are recognized in income on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses, including losses from declines in value of specific securities determined by management to be other-than-temporary, are included in the statement of comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the specific securities sold.  There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Fair value measurements,"The Company’s policies incorporate the guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis.  These policies also incorporate the guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.  The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   The Company currently has no nonfinancial or financial items that are measured on a nonrecurring basis.The carrying value of cash equivalents, treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, trade receivables, accounts payable, and other financial working capital items approximate fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the short term maturity nature of these instruments. "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Inventories,"Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Property and equipment,"Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized.Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Estimated useful lives are as follows,
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Intangible assets,Intangible assets are comprised of a noncompete agreement and the HazardPROTM technology.  The cost of intangible assets is amortized on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Revenue recognition,"The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its production monitoring equipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been picked up by common carrier, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenue on products sold to customers and distributors upon shipment because the contracts do not include post-shipment obligations.  The Company may offer discounts that are recorded at the time of sale.  In addition to exchanges and warranty returns, customers have limited refund rights.  Historically, returns and refunds have been minimal and immaterial to the financial statements and are generally recognized when the returned product is received by the Company. In some situations, the Company receives advance payments from its customers. The recognition of revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the product is shipped or services performed.  "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Advertising costs,"The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expense was $ 57 and $ 59 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Research and development,"Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.  The Company incurred expenses of $810 and $560 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Income taxes,"Deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities is determined annually. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for those differences that have future tax consequences using the currently enacted tax laws and rates that apply to the periods in which they are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the current tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the portion of the deferred liability allocated to other comprehensive income. Deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that realization of the related deferred tax asset is not assured.  No valuation allowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2014 and 2013.The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Net income per common share,Basic EPS excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The following information presents the Company’s computations of basic and diluted EPS for the periods presented in the statements of comprehensive income. 
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Stock compensation,"The Company records compensation expense for stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) model.  The Company uses historical data, among other factors, to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. At December 31, 2014, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans."
