1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Cash and Cash Equivalents,Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Derivative Liability for Warrants to Purchase Common Stock,"Derivative liabilities for warrants represents the fair value of warrants issued in connection with certain private placements of shares of the Company’s common stock (see Note 7). The fair values of these warrants are presented as liabilities based on certain net cash settlement and exercise price reset, or “down round,” provisions. These derivative liabilities, which are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are calculated utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation valuation method. Changes in the fair values of these warrants are recognized as other income or expense in the related statement of operations."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Other Derivative Financial Instruments,"The Company adjusts its derivative financial instruments to fair value at each balance sheet date (see Note 6). Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded each reporting period as gains or losses in the statements of operations unless the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Fair Value Measurements,"The Company measures and records certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. GAAP provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority, referred to as Level 1, to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The next priority, referred to as Level 2, is given to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; that is, markets in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability. The lowest priority, referred to as Level 3, is given to unobservable inputs. The table below reflects the level of the inputs used in the Company’s fair value calculation for instruments carried at fair value at (see Note 7):Carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.The table below reflects the carrying values and the estimated fair values, based on Level 3 inputs, of the Company’s outstanding notes payable including the related accrued interest at December 31, 2014:"
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Inventory,"Inventory is carried at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) or net realizable value. All items included in inventory relate to the Company’s ClearPoint system. Software license inventory that is not expected to be utilized within the next twelve months is classified as a non-current asset. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for obsolete items and provides a reserve upon identification of potential obsolete items."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Property and Equipment,"Property and equipment, including certain long-term loaned ClearPoint systems, are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, principally five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,"The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets (finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment). Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable, the expected undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the net book value of the related assets. If the net book value of the related assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the assets, the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of the expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Revenue Recognition,"The Company’s revenues are comprised of: (1) product revenues resulting from the sale of ClearPoint system reusable products, disposable products and ClearTrace system components; (2) license and development arrangements; (3) development service revenues; and (4) other service revenues. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the selling price or fee is fixed or determinable, collection is reasonably assured and, for product revenues, risk of loss has transferred to the customer. For all sales, the Company requires either a purchase agreement or a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. The Company analyzes revenue recognition on an agreement by agreement basis. The Company determines whether the deliverables under the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined by GAAP. Application of GAAP regarding multiple-element arrangements requires management to make subjective judgments about the values of the individual elements and whether delivered elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship.Sales of ClearPoint system reusable products: Generally, revenues related to the sale of ClearPoint system reusable products are recognized upon installation of the system and the completion of training of at least one of the customer’s physicians, which typically occurs concurrently with the installation. Reusable products include software which is integral to the utility of the system as a whole. Sales of reusable products that have stand-alone value to the customer are recognized when risk of loss passes to the customer. Sales of ClearPoint reusable products to a distributor that has been trained to perform system installations and to conduct ClearPoint physician training are recognized at the time risk of loss passes to the distributor.Sales of disposable products: Revenues from the sale of disposable products, including ClearPoint system disposable products, are recognized at the time risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at shipping point or upon delivery to the customer’s location, depending on the agreed upon terms with the customer.Sales of ClearTrace components: Sales of ClearTrace system components to research sites for non-commercial use are recognized at the time risk of loss passes to the customer, which is generally at shipping point or upon delivery to the customer’s location, depending on the agreed upon terms with the customer. The Company does not have regulatory clearance or approval to sell ClearTrace system components for commercial use."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Product Warranties,"The Company’s standard policy is to warrant ClearPoint system reusable products against defects in material or workmanship for one year following installation. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and continues to be an immaterial amount. A periodic review of warranty obligations is performed to determine the adequacy of the reserve and adjustments, recorded to cost of product revenues, are made to the estimated warranty liability (included in other accrued liabilities) as appropriate."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Research and Development Costs,"Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred. These costs include direct salary and employee benefit-related costs for research and development personnel, costs for materials used in research and development activities, sponsored research and costs for outside services. Since most of the expenses associated with the Company’s development service revenues relate to existing internal resources, these amounts are included in research and development costs."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Income Taxes,"Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis. Such assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income or loss in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred income tax assets unless, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred income tax assets will be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Net Loss Per Share,"Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without giving consideration to common stock equivalents. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share does not include the weighted average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share. The following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because of the anti-dilutive result:"
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Share-Based Compensation,"The Company accounts for compensation for all arrangements under which employees and others receive shares of stock or other equity instruments (including options and warrants) based on fair value. The fair value of each award is estimated as of the grant date and amortized as compensation expense over the requisite vesting period. The fair values of the Company’s share-based awards are estimated on the grant dates using the Black-Scholes valuation model. This valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock volatility, estimated award terms and risk-free interest rates for the expected terms. To estimate the expected terms, the Company utilizes the “simplified” method for “plain vanilla” options discussed in the Staff Accounting Bulletin 107 (“SAB 107”) issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company believes that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method apply to the Company and the Company’s share-based compensation arrangements. The Company intends to utilize the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior becomes available. The Company based its estimate of expected volatility on the average of historical volatilities of publicly traded companies it deemed similar to the Company because the Company lacks its own relevant historical volatility data. The Company will consistently apply this methodology until it has sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the Company’s own share prices to use as the input for all of its fair value calculations for share-based compensation. The Company utilizes risk-free interest rates based on zero-coupon U.S. treasury instruments, the terms of which are consistent with the expected terms of the equity awards. The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its shares of common stock; therefore, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Fair Value Determination of Share-Based Transactions,"Since May 21, 2012, the Company’s common stock has been traded in the over-the-counter market and has been quoted on the OTCQB marketplace and the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol MRIC. Since the Company’s common stock has been publicly traded, the closing stock price has been used as a key input in determining the fair value for share-based transactions. Prior to the time the Company’s stock became publicly traded, the fair value of the Company’s common stock, as well as the common stock underlying options and warrants, granted as compensation, or issued in connection with the settlement of liabilities (“share-based transactions”), were estimated by management, with input from a third-party valuation specialist from time to time.Determining the fair value of shares of privately held companies requires making complex and subjective judgments. Prior to the time the Company’s common stock was publicly traded, the Company used the income approach, the market approach, and the probability weighted expected return method to estimate the enterprise values for the dates on which these transactions occurred. The assumptions used in each of the different valuation methods take into account certain discounts such as selecting the appropriate discount rate and control and lack of marketability discounts. The discount rates used in these valuations ranged from 22% to 35%. The discounts for lack of marketability ranged from 15% to 35% and the discounts for lack of control ranged from 20% to 30%. If different discount rates or lack of marketability and control discounts had been used, the valuations would have been different. The enterprise value under each valuation method was allocated to preferred and common shares taking into account the enterprise value available to all stockholders and allocating that value among the various classes of stock based on the rights, privileges, and preferences of the respective classes in order to provide an estimate of the fair value of a share of the Company’s common stock. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Concentration Risks and Other Risks and Uncertainties,"Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company holds its cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions in the United States insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At December 31, 2014, the Company had bank balances in excess of the insured limits of approximately $514,000, most of which was held on deposit to satisfy outstanding checks.Accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and all product revenues recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, relate to sales and services to customers located in the United States (“U.S.”) and to one distributor. At December 31, 2014, two customers in the U.S. represented 20% and 17% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2013, three customers in the U.S. represented 28%, 18% and 15% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. No other customer represented more that 8.5% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 or 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales to one customer represented 10.4% of product revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to one customer represented 20% of product revenues. No other single customer represented greater than 9% of product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company will provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collections become doubtful, but the Company has not experienced any credit losses or recorded any allowances to date.The Company is subject to risks common to emerging companies in the medical device industry, including, but not limited to: new technological innovations; dependence on key personnel; dependence on key suppliers; changes in general economic conditions and interest rates; protection of proprietary technology; compliance with changing government regulations; uncertainty of widespread market acceptance of products; access to credit for capital purchases by customers; and product liability claims. Certain components used in manufacturing have relatively few alternative sources of supply, and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly. The inability of any of these suppliers to fulfill the Company’s supply requirements may negatively impact future operating results."
1285550,Note_2_Summary_of_Significant_,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which creates a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for the Company beginning in 2017 and allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on its consolidated financial statements.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if “conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.” The ASU applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this update on future disclosures concerning its liquidity position."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Preamble,"1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesControl4 Corporation (“Control4” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of automation and control solutions for the connected home. The Company unlocks the potential of connected devices, making entertainment systems easier to use, homes more comfortable, appliances more energy efficient, and families more secure. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 27, 2003."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Reclassifications,"Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current-year presentation. A reclassification was made from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) related to foreign currency transaction gains (losses). As a result, income from operations is impacted by $0 and $34,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, but this reclassification did not impact previously reported net income, or related per share amounts. In addition, a reclassification was made related to international hospitality revenue previously disclosed as United States hospitality revenue. The reclassification did not materially impact previous disclosures related to geographic information. Furthermore, this reclassification had no effect on previously reported amounts related to total revenue, income from continuing operations, net income or related per share amounts, and does not impact previous disclosures regarding concentrations of revenue."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Basis of Presentation,The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Segment Reporting,"Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, the Chief Executive Officer, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and accessing performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as one operating segment."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Concentrations of Risk,"The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from its worldwide network of independent dealers and distributors. The Company’s sales to dealers and distributors located outside the United States are generally denominated in United States dollars, except for sales to dealers and distributors located in the United Kingdom and the European Union, which are generally denominated in pounds sterling and the euro, respectively. There were no individual account balances greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.No dealer or distributor accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for its contract manufacturing. A significant disruption in the operations of these manufacturers would impact the production of the Company’s products for a substantial period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Geographic Information,"The Company’s revenue includes amounts earned through sales to dealers and distributors located outside of the United States. With the exception of Canada, no single foreign country accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The following table sets forth revenue from the U.S., Canadian and all other international dealers and distributors combined (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Use of Accounting Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition, sales returns, provisions for doubtful accounts, product warranty, inventory obsolescence, litigation, determination of fair value of stock options, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes. Actual results may differ from those estimates."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Product Warranty,"The Company provides its customers a limited product warranty of two years, which requires the Company, at its option, to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer or refund the purchase price. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred to replace, repair or issue a refund for defective products and records a reserve at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed systems, the Company’s historical experience and management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of product warranty returns, net of refurbished products. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability each period and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary. Warranty costs accrued includes amounts accrued for products at the time of shipment, adjustments for changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in the period, and changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in prior periods. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amounts applicable to each of these components.The following table presents the changes in the product warranty liability (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Net Income (Loss) Per Share,"Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period that have a dilutive effect on net income per share. Potentially dilutive common shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and warrants using the if-converted method. In a net loss position, diluted net loss per share is computed using only the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as any additional common shares would be anti-dilutive.The following table presents the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Numerator:,
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Denominator:,The following weighted-average common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands):
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Revenue Recognition,"The Company sells its products through a network of independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors generally sell the Company’s products to the end consumer as part of a bundled sale, which typically includes other third-party products and related services, project design and installation services and on-going support.The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for dealer, retailer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of volume rebates, at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms and the Company’s historical experience and trend analysis. The most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to dealers and distributors for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.The Company’s products include embedded software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware. Accordingly, the hardware and embedded software are accounted for as a single deliverable. In 2013, the Company began bundling Control4 App software licenses with its new controllers. These software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates (e.g., when-and-if-available enhancements or upgrades to the functionality of the software) or post-contract customer support such as technical support. When a software license and controller are sold together, a multiple element arrangement exists and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling prices. Typically, delivery of both the product and the software license occurs at the same time. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product or licensed software is considered delivered once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.Software license revenue represents fees earned from activating applications which allow end consumers to manage and control their automation systems using tablets, smartphones and other third-party devices. Software products such as Composer Home and Media Editions are sold on a limited basis and do not constitute a significant portion of revenue. The Company’s perpetual software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates or upgrades or post-contract customer support such as technical support; the Company generally recognizes revenue at the time the software license is provided.The Company offers a subscription service that allows consumers to control and monitor their homes remotely and allows the Company’s dealers to perform remote diagnostic services. Subscription revenue is deferred at the time of payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the service is provided.  Total revenue for subscription services represents less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.The Company recognizes revenue net of cost of revenue for third-party products sold through the Company’s online ordering system. While the Company assumes credit risk on sales to its dealers and distributors for third-party products, the Company does not determine the product selling price, does not retain associated inventory risks and is not the primary obligor to the end consumer.The Company’s agreements with dealers and distributors generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions. Even though contractual agreements do not provide return privileges, there are circumstances in which the Company will accept returns. In addition, agreements with certain retail distributors contain price protection and limited rights of return. The Company maintains a reserve for such returns based on the Company’s historical return experience.Shipping charges billed to dealers and distributors are included in revenue and related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Cost of Revenue,"Cost of revenue includes the following: the cost of inventory sold during the period, inventory write-down costs, payroll, purchasing costs, royalty obligations, shipping expenses to dealers and distributors and warehousing costs, which include inbound freight costs from manufacturers, rent and payroll and benefit costs."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Cash and Cash Equivalents,The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Restricted Cash,"Restricted cash as of December 31, 2014, is composed of a guarantee made by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom to HM Revenue & Customs related to a customs duty deferment account."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Allowance for Doubtful Accounts,"The Company extends credit to the majority of its dealers and distributors, which consist primarily of small, local businesses. Issuance of credit is based on ongoing credit evaluations by the Company of dealers’ and distributors’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible receivables. The allowance is based upon the creditworthiness of the Company’s dealers and distributors, the dealers’ and distributors’ historical payment experience, the age of the receivables and current market and economic conditions. Provisions for potentially uncollectible accounts are recorded in sales and marketing expenses. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances to the allowance for doubtful accounts when it becomes likely that they will not be collected.The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Inventories,"Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of its inventory and reduces the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in excess of forecasted sales requirements. Inventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as a cost of revenue and totaled $1.5 million, $2.3 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.In December 2012, the Company finalized termination of a sales contract and, as a result of the contract termination, recorded a $1.8 million expense associated with an anticipated loss on firm purchase commitments for components that would have been required to meet the Company’s obligations under the terminated contract. The $1.8 million charge has been recorded as Cost of Revenue—Inventory Purchase Commitment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2012.In 2013, the Company recorded a gain related to inventory purchase commitments of approximately $0.4 million, as the proceeds from liquidating the underlying inventory and the Company’s ability to consume common components exceeded original estimates."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Property and Equipment,"Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life of or improve the asset are expensed in the year incurred. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful life (usually 3-8 years) or the life of the associated lease, whichever is less. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded approximately $0.7 million of leasehold improvement assets that were paid by the landlord, with a corresponding long-term liability as the tenant improvement allowance was determined to be an incentive for renewing the lease."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Intangible Assets,"Intangible assets primarily consist of acquired technology. The Company amortizes, to cost of revenue, definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the life of the technology."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Foreign Currency Translation,"The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong and India are the Pound Sterling, the Chinese Yuan, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Indian Rupee, respectively. The subsidiary’s assets and liabilities have been translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Statements of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for each year. Resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) resulting from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in other income (expense) and have not been material for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 or 2014."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Stock-Based Compensation,"The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards issued to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. The Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value at the date of grant for stock options. The Company elected to amortize compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method, under which stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee performs the related services, generally the vesting period of four years, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has estimated forfeiture rates based on its historical experience and will update the rates, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management assumptions regarding various factors that require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. The Company estimates the expected term for options using the simplified method, which utilizes the weighted average expected life of each tranche of the stock option, determined based on the sum of each tranche’s vesting period plus one-half of the period from the vesting date of each tranche to the stock option’s expiration, because the Company’s options are considered “plain vanilla.” The Company computed the expected volatility using multiple peer companies for a period approximating the expected term. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term within the expected life of the award.The Company accounts for stock-based instruments and awards issued to non-employees at fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management believes that the fair value of the stock-based awards is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of each non-employee award is re-measured each period until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting date."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Income Taxes,"The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company provides for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of its income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we did not record any material interest income, interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions or the settlement of audits for prior periods."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Presentation of Certain Taxes,The Company collects various taxes from dealers and distributors and remits these amounts to the applicable taxing authorities. The Company’s accounting policy is to exclude these taxes from revenue and cost of revenue.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Research and Development,"Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including incentive compensation, depreciation associated with research and development equipment, contract labor and consulting services, facilities- related costs, and travel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, ‘‘Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.’’ The amended guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows as it relates only to financial statement presentation.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2004-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which amends the guidance in ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance as well as whether the Company will apply the amendments retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying this update at the date of initial application.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, ‘‘Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).’’ The amended guidance requires an entity to prepare financial statements under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting, if liquidation of the entity becomes imminent. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending on December 31, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Preamble,"Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the current-year presentation. A reclassification was made from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense) related to foreign currency transaction gains (losses). As a result, income from operations is impacted by $0 and $34,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively, but this reclassification did not impact previously reported net income, or related per share amounts. In addition, a reclassification was made related to international hospitality revenue previously disclosed as United States hospitality revenue. The reclassification did not materially impact previous disclosures related to geographic information. Furthermore, this reclassification had no effect on previously reported amounts related to total revenue, income from continuing operations, net income or related per share amounts, and does not impact previous disclosures regarding concentrations of revenue."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Basis of Presentation,The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Segment Reporting,"Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision-maker, the Chief Executive Officer, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and accessing performance. To date, the Company has viewed its operations and manages its business as one operating segment."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Concentrations of Risk,"The Company’s accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from its worldwide network of independent dealers and distributors. The Company’s sales to dealers and distributors located outside the United States are generally denominated in United States dollars, except for sales to dealers and distributors located in the United Kingdom and the European Union, which are generally denominated in pounds sterling and the euro, respectively. There were no individual account balances greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.No dealer or distributor accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014.The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for its contract manufacturing. A significant disruption in the operations of these manufacturers would impact the production of the Company’s products for a substantial period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Geographic Information,"The Company’s revenue includes amounts earned through sales to dealers and distributors located outside of the United States. With the exception of Canada, no single foreign country accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The following table sets forth revenue from the U.S., Canadian and all other international dealers and distributors combined (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Use of Accounting Estimates,"The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition, sales returns, provisions for doubtful accounts, product warranty, inventory obsolescence, litigation, determination of fair value of stock options, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income taxes. Actual results may differ from those estimates."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Product Warranty,"The Company provides its customers a limited product warranty of two years, which requires the Company, at its option, to repair or replace defective products during the warranty period at no cost to the customer or refund the purchase price. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred to replace, repair or issue a refund for defective products and records a reserve at the time revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the number of installed systems, the Company’s historical experience and management’s judgment regarding anticipated rates of product warranty returns, net of refurbished products. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability each period and makes adjustments to the liability as necessary. Warranty costs accrued includes amounts accrued for products at the time of shipment, adjustments for changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in the period, and changes in estimated costs for warranties on products shipped in prior periods. It is not practicable for the Company to determine the amounts applicable to each of these components.The following table presents the changes in the product warranty liability (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Net Income (Loss) Per Share,"Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period that have a dilutive effect on net income per share. Potentially dilutive common shares result from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of outstanding convertible preferred stock and warrants using the if-converted method. In a net loss position, diluted net loss per share is computed using only the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as any additional common shares would be anti-dilutive.The following table presents the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Numerator:,
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Denominator:,The following weighted-average common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands):
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Revenue Recognition,"The Company sells its products through a network of independent dealers, regional and national retailers and distributors. These dealers, retailers and distributors generally sell the Company’s products to the end consumer as part of a bundled sale, which typically includes other third-party products and related services, project design and installation services and on-going support.The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for dealer, retailer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of volume rebates, at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms and the Company’s historical experience and trend analysis. The most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to dealers and distributors for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.The Company’s products include embedded software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware. Accordingly, the hardware and embedded software are accounted for as a single deliverable. In 2013, the Company began bundling Control4 App software licenses with its new controllers. These software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates (e.g., when-and-if-available enhancements or upgrades to the functionality of the software) or post-contract customer support such as technical support. When a software license and controller are sold together, a multiple element arrangement exists and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on relative selling prices. Typically, delivery of both the product and the software license occurs at the same time. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product or licensed software is considered delivered once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.Software license revenue represents fees earned from activating applications which allow end consumers to manage and control their automation systems using tablets, smartphones and other third-party devices. Software products such as Composer Home and Media Editions are sold on a limited basis and do not constitute a significant portion of revenue. The Company’s perpetual software licenses do not include acceptance provisions, rights to updates or upgrades or post-contract customer support such as technical support; the Company generally recognizes revenue at the time the software license is provided.The Company offers a subscription service that allows consumers to control and monitor their homes remotely and allows the Company’s dealers to perform remote diagnostic services. Subscription revenue is deferred at the time of payment and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the service is provided.  Total revenue for subscription services represents less than 10% of total revenue for all periods presented.The Company recognizes revenue net of cost of revenue for third-party products sold through the Company’s online ordering system. While the Company assumes credit risk on sales to its dealers and distributors for third-party products, the Company does not determine the product selling price, does not retain associated inventory risks and is not the primary obligor to the end consumer.The Company’s agreements with dealers and distributors generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions. Even though contractual agreements do not provide return privileges, there are circumstances in which the Company will accept returns. In addition, agreements with certain retail distributors contain price protection and limited rights of return. The Company maintains a reserve for such returns based on the Company’s historical return experience.Shipping charges billed to dealers and distributors are included in revenue and related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Cost of Revenue,"Cost of revenue includes the following: the cost of inventory sold during the period, inventory write-down costs, payroll, purchasing costs, royalty obligations, shipping expenses to dealers and distributors and warehousing costs, which include inbound freight costs from manufacturers, rent and payroll and benefit costs."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Cash and Cash Equivalents,The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Restricted Cash,"Restricted cash as of December 31, 2014, is composed of a guarantee made by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom to HM Revenue & Customs related to a customs duty deferment account."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Allowance for Doubtful Accounts,"The Company extends credit to the majority of its dealers and distributors, which consist primarily of small, local businesses. Issuance of credit is based on ongoing credit evaluations by the Company of dealers’ and distributors’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potential uncollectible receivables. The allowance is based upon the creditworthiness of the Company’s dealers and distributors, the dealers’ and distributors’ historical payment experience, the age of the receivables and current market and economic conditions. Provisions for potentially uncollectible accounts are recorded in sales and marketing expenses. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances to the allowance for doubtful accounts when it becomes likely that they will not be collected.The following table presents the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):"
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Inventories,"Inventories consist of hardware and related component parts and are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of its inventory and reduces the carrying value of the inventory when items are determined to be obsolete, defective or in excess of forecasted sales requirements. Inventory write-downs for excess, defective and obsolete inventory are recorded as a cost of revenue and totaled $1.5 million, $2.3 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.In December 2012, the Company finalized termination of a sales contract and, as a result of the contract termination, recorded a $1.8 million expense associated with an anticipated loss on firm purchase commitments for components that would have been required to meet the Company’s obligations under the terminated contract. The $1.8 million charge has been recorded as Cost of Revenue—Inventory Purchase Commitment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2012.In 2013, the Company recorded a gain related to inventory purchase commitments of approximately $0.4 million, as the proceeds from liquidating the underlying inventory and the Company’s ability to consume common components exceeded original estimates."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Property and Equipment,"Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the life of or improve the asset are expensed in the year incurred. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the estimated useful life (usually 3-8 years) or the life of the associated lease, whichever is less. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded approximately $0.7 million of leasehold improvement assets that were paid by the landlord, with a corresponding long-term liability as the tenant improvement allowance was determined to be an incentive for renewing the lease."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Intangible Assets,"Intangible assets primarily consist of acquired technology. The Company amortizes, to cost of revenue, definite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the life of the technology."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Foreign Currency Translation,"The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong and India are the Pound Sterling, the Chinese Yuan, the Hong Kong Dollar and the Indian Rupee, respectively. The subsidiary’s assets and liabilities have been translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Statements of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for each year. Resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) resulting from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in other income (expense) and have not been material for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 or 2014."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Stock-Based Compensation,"The Company recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based awards issued to employees and directors based on estimated grant date fair values. The Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the estimated fair value at the date of grant for stock options. The Company elected to amortize compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method, under which stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period the employee performs the related services, generally the vesting period of four years, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has estimated forfeiture rates based on its historical experience and will update the rates, as necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires management assumptions regarding various factors that require extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. The Company estimates the expected term for options using the simplified method, which utilizes the weighted average expected life of each tranche of the stock option, determined based on the sum of each tranche’s vesting period plus one-half of the period from the vesting date of each tranche to the stock option’s expiration, because the Company’s options are considered “plain vanilla.” The Company computed the expected volatility using multiple peer companies for a period approximating the expected term. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield on U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term within the expected life of the award.The Company accounts for stock-based instruments and awards issued to non-employees at fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management believes that the fair value of the stock-based awards is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of each non-employee award is re-measured each period until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting date."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Income Taxes,"The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.The Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by various tax authorities. The Company provides for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.The Company recognizes uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.The Company’s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of its income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, we did not record any material interest income, interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions or the settlement of audits for prior periods."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Presentation of Certain Taxes,The Company collects various taxes from dealers and distributors and remits these amounts to the applicable taxing authorities. The Company’s accounting policy is to exclude these taxes from revenue and cost of revenue.
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Research and Development,"Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including incentive compensation, depreciation associated with research and development equipment, contract labor and consulting services, facilities- related costs, and travel-related costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred."
1259515,Description_of_Business_and_Su1,Recent Accounting Pronouncements,"In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, ‘‘Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.’’ The amended guidance requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows as it relates only to financial statement presentation.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2004-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which amends the guidance in ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

Early application is not permitted.  The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance as well as whether the Company will apply the amendments retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying this update at the date of initial application.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, ‘‘Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).’’ The amended guidance requires an entity to prepare financial statements under the liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic 205-30, Presentation of Financial Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting, if liquidation of the entity becomes imminent. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending on December 31, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Nature of business:,"The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Electro-Sensors, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, ESI Investment Company and Senstar Corporation. Senstar has no operations.  Intercompany accounts, transactions and earnings have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated entity is referred to as “the Company” or “ESI”.Electro-Sensors, Inc. manufactures and markets a complete line of speed monitoring and motor control systems for industrial machinery. The Company uses leading-edge technology to continuously improve its products and make them easier to use, with the ultimate goal of manufacturing the industry-preferred product for every market served. The Company’s products are sold through an internal sales staff, manufacturer’s representatives, and distributors in a wide variety of manufacturers and processors who use the products to monitor process machinery operations. The Company markets its products to a variety of different industries located throughout the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia.In addition, through its subsidiary ESI Investment Company, the Company periodically makes strategic investments in other businesses, primarily when the Company believes that these investments will facilitate development of technology complementary to the Company’s products. Although ESI, through its subsidiary ESI Investment Company, invests in other businesses, the Company does not intend to become an investment company and intends to remain primarily an operating company.    See Note 3 for additional information regarding its investments.  The Company’s investments in securities are subject to normal market risks.Significant accounting policies of the Company are summarized below:"
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Use of estimates,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, including the underlying assumptions, consist of the economic lives of long lived assets, realizability of accounts receivable, and valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities, inventory, investments, allocation of the purchase price for acquired tangible and intangible assets, contingent earn-out, and stock compensation expense. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates may change in the near term."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Cash and cash equivalents,"The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are invested in commercial paper, money market accounts and may also be invested in three month Treasury Bills.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value.The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in primarily one bank deposit account, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Trade receivables and credit policies,"Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date.  Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer.  Customer account balances with invoices over 90 days are considered delinquent. The Company does not accrue interest on delinquent trade receivables.Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  Management individually reviews all trade receivable balances that exceed 90 days from the invoice date and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that may not be collected.  Management uses this information to estimate the allowance."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Available-for-sale securities,"The Company’s investments consist of equity securities, primarily common stocks and government debt securities.  The estimated fair value of publicly traded equity securities is based on reported market prices, and therefore subject to the inherent risk of market fluctuations.  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investments are acquired, and evaluates the appropriateness of this classification at each balance sheet date.Since the Company does not buy and sell investments with the objective of generating profits on short-term fluctuations in market price, the investments in marketable equity securities have been classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and within accumulated other comprehensive income. Dividends on marketable equity securities are recognized in income on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses, including losses from declines in value of specific securities determined by management to be other-than-temporary, are included in the statement of comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the specific securities sold.  There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Fair value measurements,"The Company’s policies incorporate the guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis.  These policies also incorporate the guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.  The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   The Company currently has no nonfinancial or financial items that are measured on a nonrecurring basis.The carrying value of cash equivalents, treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, trade receivables, accounts payable, and other financial working capital items approximate fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the short term maturity nature of these instruments. "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Inventories,"Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Property and equipment,"Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized.Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals."

351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Revenue recognition,"The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of its production monitoring equipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been picked up by common carrier, the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenue on products sold to customers and distributors upon shipment because the contracts do not include post-shipment obligations.  The Company may offer discounts that are recorded at the time of sale.  In addition to exchanges and warranty returns, customers have limited refund rights.  Historically, returns and refunds have been minimal and immaterial to the financial statements and are generally recognized when the returned product is received by the Company. In some situations, the Company receives advance payments from its customers. The recognition of revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the product is shipped or services performed.  "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Advertising costs,"The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Total advertising expense was $ 57 and $ 59 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Research and development,"Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred.  The Company incurred expenses of $810 and $560 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively."
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Income taxes,"Deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. The difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities is determined annually. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for those differences that have future tax consequences using the currently enacted tax laws and rates that apply to the periods in which they are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense is the current tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the net change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the portion of the deferred liability allocated to other comprehensive income. Deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that realization of the related deferred tax asset is not assured.  No valuation allowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2014 and 2013.The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. "
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Net income per common share,Basic EPS excludes dilution and is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. The following information presents the Company’s computations of basic and diluted EPS for the periods presented in the statements of comprehensive income. 
351789,Basis_of_Presentation,Stock compensation,"The Company records compensation expense for stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) model.  The Company uses historical data, among other factors, to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. At December 31, 2014, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Preamble,"The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates, including the underlying assumptions, consist of the economic lives of long lived assets, realizability of accounts receivable, and valuation of deferred tax assets/liabilities, inventory, investments, allocation of the purchase price for acquired tangible and intangible assets, contingent earn-out, and stock compensation expense. It is at least reasonably possible that these estimates may change in the near term."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Cash and cash equivalents,"The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are invested in commercial paper, money market accounts and may also be invested in three month Treasury Bills.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value.The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in primarily one bank deposit account, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on these accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Trade receivables and credit policies,"Trade receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms requiring payment within 30 days from the invoice date.  Trade receivables are stated at the amount billed to the customer.  Customer account balances with invoices over 90 days are considered delinquent. The Company does not accrue interest on delinquent trade receivables.Payments of trade receivables are allocated to the specific invoices identified on the customer’s remittance advice or, if unspecified, are applied to the earliest unpaid invoices.The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected.  Management individually reviews all trade receivable balances that exceed 90 days from the invoice date and based on an assessment of current creditworthiness, estimates the portion, if any, of the balance that may not be collected.  Management uses this information to estimate the allowance."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Available-for-sale securities,"The Company’s investments consist of equity securities, primarily common stocks and government debt securities.  The estimated fair value of publicly traded equity securities is based on reported market prices, and therefore subject to the inherent risk of market fluctuations.  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investments are acquired, and evaluates the appropriateness of this classification at each balance sheet date.Since the Company does not buy and sell investments with the objective of generating profits on short-term fluctuations in market price, the investments in marketable equity securities have been classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and within accumulated other comprehensive income. Dividends on marketable equity securities are recognized in income on the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses, including losses from declines in value of specific securities determined by management to be other-than-temporary, are included in the statement of comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the specific securities sold.  There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized in the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Fair value measurements,"The Company’s policies incorporate the guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis.  These policies also incorporate the guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.  The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.   The Company currently has no nonfinancial or financial items that are measured on a nonrecurring basis.The carrying value of cash equivalents, treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, trade receivables, accounts payable, and other financial working capital items approximate fair value at December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to the short term maturity nature of these instruments. "
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Inventories,"Inventories include material, labor and overhead and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market."
351789,Basis_Of_Presentation_Policy,Property and equipment,"Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over estimated useful lives by use of the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized.Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals."

13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,1.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ,"A.       About NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO NU Consolidated: NU is a public utility holding company primarily engaged through its wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries in the energy delivery business. On April 10, 2012, NU acquired NSTAR and its subsidiaries. See Note 21, ""Merger of NU and NSTAR,"" for further information regarding the merger. NU's wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas. NU provides energy delivery service to approximately 3.6 million electric and natural gas customers through these six regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On February 2, 2015, NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO commenced doing business as Eversource Energy.NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NU is a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Arrangements among the regulated electric companies and other NU companies, outside agencies and other utilities covering interconnections, interchange of electric power and sales of utility property are subject to regulation by the FERC. The Regulated companies are subject to regulation of rates, accounting and other matters by the FERC and/or applicable state regulatory commissions (the PURA for CL&P and Yankee Gas, the DPU for NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas, and the NHPUC for PSNH).Regulated Companies: CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO furnish franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas are engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Connecticut and central and eastern Massachusetts, respectively. CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO's results include the operations of their respective distribution and transmission businesses. PSNH and WMECO's distribution results include the operations of their respective generation businesses. NU also has a regulated subsidiary, NPT, which was formed to construct, own and operate the Northern Pass line, a HVDC transmission line from Québec to New Hampshire under development that will interconnect with a new HVDC transmission line being developed by a transmission subsidiary of HQ. Other: NUSCO, NU's service company, Rocky River Realty Company, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of NU, Renewable Properties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of EETV, and Properties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSNH, provide support services to NU, including its regulated companies. Harbor Electric Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR Electric, provides distribution service and ongoing support to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Hopkinton LNG Corp, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of NU, provides natural gas liquefaction, vaporization, and storage services for NSTAR Gas. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,B.       Basis of Presentation ,"The consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P and WMECO are herein collectively referred to as the ""financial statements."" The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NU's consolidated financial information includes NSTAR and its subsidiaries' results of operations beginning April 10, 2012. The information disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2012 for NSTAR Electric is presented on a comparable basis. NU consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's combined ownership interest in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the NU financial statements. NU's utility subsidiaries are subject to the application of accounting guidance for entities with rate-regulated operations that considers the effect of regulation resulting from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries. NU's utility subsidiaries' distribution, generation and transmission businesses and NPT are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of rate-regulated accounting. See Note 2, ""Regulatory Accounting,"" for further information.Certain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the accompanying balance sheets for NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. These reclassifications were made to conform to the current year presentation.In accordance with accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric, which are not owned by NU or its consolidated subsidiaries and are not subject to mandatory redemption, have been presented as noncontrolling interests in the financial statements of NU.  The Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric are considered to be temporary equity and have been classified between liabilities and permanent shareholders' equity on the balance sheets of NU, CL&P and NSTAR Electric due to a provision in the preferred stock agreements of both CL&P and NSTAR Electric that grant preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority of the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Board of Directors, respectively, should certain conditions exist, such as if preferred dividends are in arrears for a specified amount of time.  The Net Income reported in the statements of income and cash flows represents net income prior to apportionment to noncontrolling interests, which is represented by dividends on preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NU's carrying amount of goodwill was approximately $3.5 billion. NU performs an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually. NU completed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units as of October 1, 2014 and determined that no impairment exists. See Note 22, ""Goodwill,"" for further information."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,C.       Accounting Standards ,"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: On January 1, 2014, as required, NU prospectively adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) final Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that required presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets. Implementation of this guidance had an immaterial impact on the balance sheets and no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO.Accounting Standards Issued but not Yet Adopted: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2017, which amends existing revenue recognition guidance and is required to be applied retrospectively (either to each reporting period presented or cumulatively at the date of initial application). Management is reviewing the requirements of the ASU. The ASU's impact is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,D.       Cash and Cash Equivalents,"Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash and Cash Equivalents to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,E.       Provision for Uncollectible Accounts,"NU, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, presents its receivables at estimated net realizable value by maintaining a provision for uncollectible accounts. This provision is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including the application of an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category. The estimate is based upon historical collection and write-off experience and management's assessment of collectability from customers. Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts collectability estimates based on actual experience. Receivable balances are written off against the provision for uncollectible accounts when the accounts are terminated and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible. The PURA allows CL&P and Yankee Gas to accelerate the recovery of accounts receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (uncollectible hardship accounts receivable) outstanding for greater than 90 days. The DPU allows WMECO to also recover in rates amounts associated with certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable. Uncollectible customer account balances, which are expected to be recovered in rates, are included in Regulatory Assets or Other Long-Term Assets. The total provision for uncollectible accounts and for uncollectible hardship accounts, which is included in the total provision, are included in Receivables, Net on the balance sheets, and were as follows:"
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,"F.       Fuel, Materials and Supplies and Allowance Inventory ","Fuel, Materials and Supplies include natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories as well as materials purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes. Natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories are valued at their respective weighted average cost. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. As of December 31, 2014, NU and PSNH had $164.3 million and $95.1 million, respectively, of fuel and $185.4 million and $53 million, respectively, of materials and supplies. As of December 31, 2013, NU and PSNH had $139.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively, of fuel and $163.7 million and $54.5 million, respectively, of materials and supplies.Fuel, Materials and Supplies also include Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which are purchased from suppliers of renewable sources of generation. RECs are used to meet state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NSTAR Electric had $25.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of RECs classified as Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets. PSNH is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, CO2, and NOx related to its regulated generation units, and uses SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances. At the end of each compliance period, PSNH is required to relinquish SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances corresponding to the actual respective emissions emitted by its generating units over the compliance period. SO2 and NOx emissions allowances are obtained through an annual allocation from the federal and state regulators that are granted at no cost and through purchases from third parties. CO2 emissions allowances are obtained through an annual allocation from the state regulator that are granted at no cost and are acquired through auctions and through purchases from third parties. SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances are charged to expense based on their weighted average cost as they are utilized against emissions volumes at PSNH's generating units. SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances are recorded within Fuel, Materials and Supplies and are classified on the balance sheet as short-term or long-term depending on the period in which they are expected to be utilized against actual emissions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, PSNH had $20.1 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of long-term SO2 and CO2 emissions allowances classified as Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,G.       Restricted Cash and Other Deposits,"As of December 31, 2014, NU, CL&P and PSNH had $3.2 million, $2.1 million, and $1 million respectively, of restricted cash relating to amounts held in escrow, which were included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts were $1.7 million and $1.4 million for NU and CL&P, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, NU, CL&P and PSNH had $9.9 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of cash collateral posted not subject to master netting agreements, primarily with ISO-NE, which were included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts were $17.9 million and $9 million for NU and NSTAR Electric, respectively."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,H.       Fair Value Measurements,"Fair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as ""normal purchases or normal sales"" (normal) and to the marketable securities held in trusts. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs, and is also used to estimate the fair value of preferred stock and long-term debt.Fair Value Hierarchy: In measuring fair value, NU uses observable market data when available and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs used in fair value measurements are categorized into three fair value hierarchy levels for disclosure purposes. The entire fair value measurement is categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NU evaluates the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a quarterly basis, and NU's policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.Level 3 - Quoted market prices are not available. Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are unobservable. Where possible, valuation techniques incorporate observable market inputs that can be validated to external sources such as industry exchanges, including prices of energy and energy-related products. Determination of Fair Value: The valuation techniques and inputs used in NU's fair value measurements are described in Note 4, ""Derivative Instruments,"" Note 5, ""Marketable Securities,"" Note 6, ""Asset Retirement Obligations,"" Note 9A, ""Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"" Note 13, ""Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"" and Note 21, ""Merger of NU and NSTAR,"" to the financial statements."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,I.       Derivative Accounting,"Many of the Regulated companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives. The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative. For the Regulated companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivative contracts, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates.The application of derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, election and designation of the normal exception, and determination of the fair value of derivative contracts. All of these judgments can have a significant impact on the financial statements. The judgment applied in the election of the normal exception (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusion that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery of the underlying product and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business in the normal course of business. If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then the normal exception and accrual accounting is terminated, and fair value accounting is applied prospectively. The fair value of derivative contracts is based upon the contract terms and conditions and the underlying market price or fair value per unit. When quantities are not specified in the contract, the Company determines whether the contract has a determinable quantity by using amounts referenced in default provisions and other relevant sections of the contract. The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and recorded as a net derivative asset or liability on the balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and do not impact net income.For further information regarding derivative contracts, see Note 4, ""Derivative Instruments,"" to the financial statements."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,J.       Equity Method Investments,"Regional Decommissioned Nuclear Companies: CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO own common stock in three regional nuclear generation companies (CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, collectively referred to as the Yankee Companies), each of which owned a single nuclear generating facility that has been decommissioned. For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, the respective investments in CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC are accounted for under the equity method. NU consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's combined ownership interest in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the NU financial statements. Ownership interests in the Yankee Companies as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:The total carrying values of CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's ownership interests in CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, which are included in Other Long-Term Assets on their respective balance sheets, were as follows: For further information on the Yankee Companies, see Note 11C, ""Commitments and Contingencies - Contractual Obligations - Yankee Companies,"" to the financial statements.Other Investments: As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NU had an equity ownership interest in an energy investment fund of $17.8 million and $9.8 million, respectively. Equity investments are included in Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets and net earnings related to these equity investments are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,K.       Revenues,"Regulated Companies: The Regulated companies' retail revenues are based on rates approved by their respective state regulatory commissions. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions. The Regulated companies' rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to their customers, including a return on investment. The Regulated companies also utilize regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms to recover certain costs on a fully-reconciling basis. These tracking mechanisms require rates to be changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred. WMECO and CL&P (effective December 1, 2014), each have a revenue decoupling mechanism to recover a pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenues per year, independent of actual customer usage. Decoupling mechanisms effectively break the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. A significant portion of the Regulated companies' retail revenues relate to the recovery of costs incurred for the sale of electricity and natural gas purchased on behalf of customers. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through cost tracking mechanisms. Energy purchases are recorded in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission, and the sale of energy associated with these purchases are recorded in Operating Revenues.Regulated Companies' Unbilled Revenues: Because customers are billed throughout the month based on pre-determined cycles rather than on a calendar month basis, an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers for which the customers have not yet been billed is calculated as of the balance sheet date. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statements of income and are assets on the balance sheets. Actual amounts billed to customers when meter readings become available may vary from the estimated amount. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled sales monthly using the daily load cycle method. The daily load cycle method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total month load, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating unbilled sales to the respective customer classes, then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales. Regulated Companies' Transmission Revenues - Wholesale Rates: Wholesale transmission revenues are recovered through FERC approved formula rates. Wholesale transmission revenues for CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO are collected under the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (ISO-NE Tariff). The ISO-NE Tariff includes Regional Network Service (RNS), Schedule 21 - NU rate schedules, which recover the costs of transmission and other transmission-related services for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate schedules, which recover costs of transmission and other transmission-related services for NSTAR Electric. The RNS rate, administered by ISO-NE and billed to all New England transmission load, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO's distribution businesses, is reset on June 1st of each year and recovers the revenue requirements associated with transmission facilities that benefit the entire New England region. Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rates, administered by NU, recovers the remainder of the transmission revenue requirements. The Schedule 21 - NU rate is reset on January 1st and June 1st of each year, while the Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate is reset on June 1st of each year. The Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate calculations recover total transmission revenue requirements net of revenues received from other sources (i.e., RNS, rentals, etc.), thereby ensuring that NU recovers all of CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's regional and local transmission revenue requirements in accordance with the ISO-NE Tariff. RNS, Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rates provide for the annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of estimated costs to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refunded to, transmission customers. See Note 11E, ""Commitments and Contingencies – FERC Base ROE Complaints,"" for complaints filed at FERC relating to NU's base ROE.Regulated Companies' Transmission Revenues - Retail Rates: A significant portion of the NU transmission segment revenue comes from ISO-NE charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, each of which recovers these costs through rates charged to their retail customers. CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO each have a retail transmission cost tracking mechanism as part of their rates, which allows the electric distribution companies to charge their retail customers for transmission costs on a timely basis."
