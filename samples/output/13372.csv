13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,1.       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ,"A.       About NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO NU Consolidated: NU is a public utility holding company primarily engaged through its wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries in the energy delivery business. On April 10, 2012, NU acquired NSTAR and its subsidiaries. See Note 21, ""Merger of NU and NSTAR,"" for further information regarding the merger. NU's wholly owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas. NU provides energy delivery service to approximately 3.6 million electric and natural gas customers through these six regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On February 2, 2015, NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO commenced doing business as Eversource Energy.NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. NU is a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. Arrangements among the regulated electric companies and other NU companies, outside agencies and other utilities covering interconnections, interchange of electric power and sales of utility property are subject to regulation by the FERC. The Regulated companies are subject to regulation of rates, accounting and other matters by the FERC and/or applicable state regulatory commissions (the PURA for CL&P and Yankee Gas, the DPU for NSTAR Electric, WMECO and NSTAR Gas, and the NHPUC for PSNH).Regulated Companies: CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO furnish franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas are engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Connecticut and central and eastern Massachusetts, respectively. CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO's results include the operations of their respective distribution and transmission businesses. PSNH and WMECO's distribution results include the operations of their respective generation businesses. NU also has a regulated subsidiary, NPT, which was formed to construct, own and operate the Northern Pass line, a HVDC transmission line from Québec to New Hampshire under development that will interconnect with a new HVDC transmission line being developed by a transmission subsidiary of HQ. Other: NUSCO, NU's service company, Rocky River Realty Company, a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary of NU, Renewable Properties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of EETV, and Properties, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSNH, provide support services to NU, including its regulated companies. Harbor Electric Energy Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NSTAR Electric, provides distribution service and ongoing support to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. Hopkinton LNG Corp, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of NU, provides natural gas liquefaction, vaporization, and storage services for NSTAR Gas. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,B.       Basis of Presentation ,"The consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of NU, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P and WMECO are herein collectively referred to as the ""financial statements."" The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NU's consolidated financial information includes NSTAR and its subsidiaries' results of operations beginning April 10, 2012. The information disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2012 for NSTAR Electric is presented on a comparable basis. NU consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's combined ownership interest in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the NU financial statements. NU's utility subsidiaries are subject to the application of accounting guidance for entities with rate-regulated operations that considers the effect of regulation resulting from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries. NU's utility subsidiaries' distribution, generation and transmission businesses and NPT are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of rate-regulated accounting. See Note 2, ""Regulatory Accounting,"" for further information.Certain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the accompanying balance sheets for NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. These reclassifications were made to conform to the current year presentation.In accordance with accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric, which are not owned by NU or its consolidated subsidiaries and are not subject to mandatory redemption, have been presented as noncontrolling interests in the financial statements of NU.  The Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric are considered to be temporary equity and have been classified between liabilities and permanent shareholders' equity on the balance sheets of NU, CL&P and NSTAR Electric due to a provision in the preferred stock agreements of both CL&P and NSTAR Electric that grant preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority of the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Board of Directors, respectively, should certain conditions exist, such as if preferred dividends are in arrears for a specified amount of time.  The Net Income reported in the statements of income and cash flows represents net income prior to apportionment to noncontrolling interests, which is represented by dividends on preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NU's carrying amount of goodwill was approximately $3.5 billion. NU performs an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually. NU completed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units as of October 1, 2014 and determined that no impairment exists. See Note 22, ""Goodwill,"" for further information."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,C.       Accounting Standards ,"Recently Adopted Accounting Standards: On January 1, 2014, as required, NU prospectively adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) final Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) that required presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets. Implementation of this guidance had an immaterial impact on the balance sheets and no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO.Accounting Standards Issued but not Yet Adopted: In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective January 1, 2017, which amends existing revenue recognition guidance and is required to be applied retrospectively (either to each reporting period presented or cumulatively at the date of initial application). Management is reviewing the requirements of the ASU. The ASU's impact is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of NU, CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,D.       Cash and Cash Equivalents,"Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash and Cash Equivalents to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,E.       Provision for Uncollectible Accounts,"NU, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, presents its receivables at estimated net realizable value by maintaining a provision for uncollectible accounts. This provision is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including the application of an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category. The estimate is based upon historical collection and write-off experience and management's assessment of collectability from customers. Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts collectability estimates based on actual experience. Receivable balances are written off against the provision for uncollectible accounts when the accounts are terminated and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible. The PURA allows CL&P and Yankee Gas to accelerate the recovery of accounts receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (uncollectible hardship accounts receivable) outstanding for greater than 90 days. The DPU allows WMECO to also recover in rates amounts associated with certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable. Uncollectible customer account balances, which are expected to be recovered in rates, are included in Regulatory Assets or Other Long-Term Assets. The total provision for uncollectible accounts and for uncollectible hardship accounts, which is included in the total provision, are included in Receivables, Net on the balance sheets, and were as follows:"
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,"F.       Fuel, Materials and Supplies and Allowance Inventory ","Fuel, Materials and Supplies include natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories as well as materials purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes. Natural gas, coal, biomass and oil inventories are valued at their respective weighted average cost. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. As of December 31, 2014, NU and PSNH had $164.3 million and $95.1 million, respectively, of fuel and $185.4 million and $53 million, respectively, of materials and supplies. As of December 31, 2013, NU and PSNH had $139.5 million and $74.2 million, respectively, of fuel and $163.7 million and $54.5 million, respectively, of materials and supplies.Fuel, Materials and Supplies also include Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), which are purchased from suppliers of renewable sources of generation. RECs are used to meet state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NSTAR Electric had $25.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of RECs classified as Materials and Supplies on the balance sheets. PSNH is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, CO2, and NOx related to its regulated generation units, and uses SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances. At the end of each compliance period, PSNH is required to relinquish SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances corresponding to the actual respective emissions emitted by its generating units over the compliance period. SO2 and NOx emissions allowances are obtained through an annual allocation from the federal and state regulators that are granted at no cost and through purchases from third parties. CO2 emissions allowances are obtained through an annual allocation from the state regulator that are granted at no cost and are acquired through auctions and through purchases from third parties. SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances are charged to expense based on their weighted average cost as they are utilized against emissions volumes at PSNH's generating units. SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions allowances are recorded within Fuel, Materials and Supplies and are classified on the balance sheet as short-term or long-term depending on the period in which they are expected to be utilized against actual emissions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, PSNH had $20.1 million and $19.4 million, respectively, of long-term SO2 and CO2 emissions allowances classified as Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,G.       Restricted Cash and Other Deposits,"As of December 31, 2014, NU, CL&P and PSNH had $3.2 million, $2.1 million, and $1 million respectively, of restricted cash relating to amounts held in escrow, which were included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts were $1.7 million and $1.4 million for NU and CL&P, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, NU, CL&P and PSNH had $9.9 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of cash collateral posted not subject to master netting agreements, primarily with ISO-NE, which were included in Prepayments and Other Current Assets on the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts were $17.9 million and $9 million for NU and NSTAR Electric, respectively."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,H.       Fair Value Measurements,"Fair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as ""normal purchases or normal sales"" (normal) and to the marketable securities held in trusts. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs, and is also used to estimate the fair value of preferred stock and long-term debt.Fair Value Hierarchy: In measuring fair value, NU uses observable market data when available and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs used in fair value measurements are categorized into three fair value hierarchy levels for disclosure purposes. The entire fair value measurement is categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. NU evaluates the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a quarterly basis, and NU's policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.Level 3 - Quoted market prices are not available. Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are unobservable. Where possible, valuation techniques incorporate observable market inputs that can be validated to external sources such as industry exchanges, including prices of energy and energy-related products. Determination of Fair Value: The valuation techniques and inputs used in NU's fair value measurements are described in Note 4, ""Derivative Instruments,"" Note 5, ""Marketable Securities,"" Note 6, ""Asset Retirement Obligations,"" Note 9A, ""Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,"" Note 13, ""Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"" and Note 21, ""Merger of NU and NSTAR,"" to the financial statements."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,I.       Derivative Accounting,"Many of the Regulated companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives. The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative. For the Regulated companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivative contracts, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates.The application of derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, election and designation of the normal exception, and determination of the fair value of derivative contracts. All of these judgments can have a significant impact on the financial statements. The judgment applied in the election of the normal exception (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusion that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery of the underlying product and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business in the normal course of business. If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then the normal exception and accrual accounting is terminated, and fair value accounting is applied prospectively. The fair value of derivative contracts is based upon the contract terms and conditions and the underlying market price or fair value per unit. When quantities are not specified in the contract, the Company determines whether the contract has a determinable quantity by using amounts referenced in default provisions and other relevant sections of the contract. The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and recorded as a net derivative asset or liability on the balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and do not impact net income.For further information regarding derivative contracts, see Note 4, ""Derivative Instruments,"" to the financial statements."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,J.       Equity Method Investments,"Regional Decommissioned Nuclear Companies: CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO own common stock in three regional nuclear generation companies (CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, collectively referred to as the Yankee Companies), each of which owned a single nuclear generating facility that has been decommissioned. For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, the respective investments in CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC are accounted for under the equity method. NU consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's combined ownership interest in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent. Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the NU financial statements. Ownership interests in the Yankee Companies as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:The total carrying values of CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's ownership interests in CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, which are included in Other Long-Term Assets on their respective balance sheets, were as follows: For further information on the Yankee Companies, see Note 11C, ""Commitments and Contingencies - Contractual Obligations - Yankee Companies,"" to the financial statements.Other Investments: As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, NU had an equity ownership interest in an energy investment fund of $17.8 million and $9.8 million, respectively. Equity investments are included in Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets and net earnings related to these equity investments are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. "
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,K.       Revenues,"Regulated Companies: The Regulated companies' retail revenues are based on rates approved by their respective state regulatory commissions. In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions. The Regulated companies' rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to their customers, including a return on investment. The Regulated companies also utilize regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms to recover certain costs on a fully-reconciling basis. These tracking mechanisms require rates to be changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred. WMECO and CL&P (effective December 1, 2014), each have a revenue decoupling mechanism to recover a pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenues per year, independent of actual customer usage. Decoupling mechanisms effectively break the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized. A significant portion of the Regulated companies' retail revenues relate to the recovery of costs incurred for the sale of electricity and natural gas purchased on behalf of customers. These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through cost tracking mechanisms. Energy purchases are recorded in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission, and the sale of energy associated with these purchases are recorded in Operating Revenues.Regulated Companies' Unbilled Revenues: Because customers are billed throughout the month based on pre-determined cycles rather than on a calendar month basis, an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers for which the customers have not yet been billed is calculated as of the balance sheet date. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statements of income and are assets on the balance sheets. Actual amounts billed to customers when meter readings become available may vary from the estimated amount. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled sales monthly using the daily load cycle method. The daily load cycle method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total month load, net of delivery losses, to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating unbilled sales to the respective customer classes, then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales. Regulated Companies' Transmission Revenues - Wholesale Rates: Wholesale transmission revenues are recovered through FERC approved formula rates. Wholesale transmission revenues for CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and WMECO are collected under the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (ISO-NE Tariff). The ISO-NE Tariff includes Regional Network Service (RNS), Schedule 21 - NU rate schedules, which recover the costs of transmission and other transmission-related services for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate schedules, which recover costs of transmission and other transmission-related services for NSTAR Electric. The RNS rate, administered by ISO-NE and billed to all New England transmission load, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO's distribution businesses, is reset on June 1st of each year and recovers the revenue requirements associated with transmission facilities that benefit the entire New England region. Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rates, administered by NU, recovers the remainder of the transmission revenue requirements. The Schedule 21 - NU rate is reset on January 1st and June 1st of each year, while the Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate is reset on June 1st of each year. The Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rate calculations recover total transmission revenue requirements net of revenues received from other sources (i.e., RNS, rentals, etc.), thereby ensuring that NU recovers all of CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's, PSNH's and WMECO's regional and local transmission revenue requirements in accordance with the ISO-NE Tariff. RNS, Schedule 21 - NU and Schedule 21 - NSTAR rates provide for the annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of estimated costs to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refunded to, transmission customers. See Note 11E, ""Commitments and Contingencies – FERC Base ROE Complaints,"" for complaints filed at FERC relating to NU's base ROE.Regulated Companies' Transmission Revenues - Retail Rates: A significant portion of the NU transmission segment revenue comes from ISO-NE charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO, each of which recovers these costs through rates charged to their retail customers. CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and WMECO each have a retail transmission cost tracking mechanism as part of their rates, which allows the electric distribution companies to charge their retail customers for transmission costs on a timely basis."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,L.       Operating Expenses,"Costs related to fuel and natural gas included in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the statements of income were as follows:(1) NSTAR Gas natural gas costs were included in NU beginning April 10, 2012."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,M.       Allowance for Funds Used During Construction,"AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction and is included in the cost of the Regulated companies' utility plant. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of Other Interest Expense, and the AFUDC related to equity funds is recorded as Other Income, Net on the statements of income. AFUDC costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a result of higher depreciation expense.The Regulated companies' average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula using the cost of a company's short-term financings and capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity), as appropriate. The average rate is applied to average eligible CWIP amounts to calculate AFUDC.(1) NSTAR amounts were included in NU beginning April 10, 2012."
13372,SUMMARY_OF_SIGNIFICANT_ACCOUNT,"N.       Other Income, Net","Items included within Other Income, Net on the statements of income primarily consist of investment income/(loss), interest income, AFUDC related to equity funds, and equity in earnings.
